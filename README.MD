### M1.1 Intro to Data Structure
#### M1.1.1 What is Data Structure
1. What is Data Structure
    * A way of **organizing** data that is stored in a computer or database
    * Many different types of data structures
    * Each type of data structure represents a different way of **organzing** the data

2. Why do we have different types of Data structures?
    * They all have different strengths and weaknesses
    * Some are fast at **storing** and **recording** data, while others are not
    * Some are fast at **searching** and **retrieving** data, while others are not

3. Why are data structures important to know?
    * Can have big impact on how **performant**, **quick** and **efficiently** a program runs.
    * Ex: Linked Lists are better when it comes to storing while hash tables are better when it comes to search.
    * Reinforce knowledge of JS algorithms and concepts. viz: constructor funcs, recursion, this keyword, prototype object, Big O notation

#### M1.1.2 constructor functions and the this keyword
1. Constructor fns are used to create new JS objects. this keyword always refers to its context
